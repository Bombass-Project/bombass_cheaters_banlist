# List of banned cheaters from our project

List of players blocked for violating rule **prohibiting the use of third-party software on our server**, contains "steamid - reason".

*This list created by an automated script that extracts data from the server database.*

Some of bans were made manually based on a thorough analysis of the player's actions in the game (wh, aimbot), some were noticed due to stupid shortcomings in cheats, some were detected by our own AC, false-positives **almost** impossible.
